# SearchProblems

Problem 1
The task is to write a recursive function to find a number in an unordered list and return the index. 
Assume that the number appears only once.

Note: A recursive function might not be the best choice tp search an unordered list. 

Problem 2
The task is to write a function to solve a number puzzle. 
I will use a "0" to represent the empty square.
